<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>

<p>My apologies for the spartan website design. Surely I will improve it someday. But for now, I am spending most of my time developing and documenting <a href="/hermits-heresy/">Hermit&rsquo;s Heresy</a>, a library of power tools for Dragon Quest Builders 2.</p>

<h1 id="study-the-blade">Study the Blade!</h1>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet seen my <a href="/stb/">Study the Blade</a> project, please check it out!</p>

<h1 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h1>

<p>I imagine I will be playing DQB2 for the rest of my life. What game could possibly dethrone it?</p>

<p>But as of July 2024, the DQB2 in-game noticeboard is not working correctly. Voting is no longer possible; every new snapshot and island has zero votes. Visiting other builders&rsquo; islands still works, for now, but the situation is concerning. If visiting ever stops working, we builders will need an unofficial replacement. And if that day comes, I hope to be ready and able to build and host it. DQB Forever!</p>

<h2 id="what-would-it-look-like">What would it look like?</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Upload snapshots (any image file). Arrange into albums/slideshows with generous-length captions.</li>
 <li>Upload save files for other people to download and &ldquo;visit&rdquo; (by temporarily adopting the save file).</li>
 <li>Public likes, private ratings, no comments.</li></ul>
