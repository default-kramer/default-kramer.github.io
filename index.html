<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>

<p>My apologies for the spartan website design. Surely I will improve it someday. But for now, I am spending most of my time developing and documenting <a href="/hermits-heresy/">Hermit&rsquo;s Heresy</a>, a library of power tools for Dragon Quest Builders 2. And that is really all you will find on this website for now.</p>

<h1 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h1>

<p>I imagine I will be playing DQB2 for the rest of my life. What game could possibly dethrone it?</p>

<p>But as of July 2024, the DQB2 in-game noticeboard is not working correctly. Voting is no longer possible; every new snapshot and island has zero votes. Visiting other builders&rsquo; islands still works, for now, but the situation is concerning. If visiting ever stops working, we builders will need an unofficial replacement. And if that day comes, I hope to be ready and able to build and host it. DQB Forever!</p>
