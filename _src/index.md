# Welcome
My apologies for the spartan website design.
Surely I will improve it someday.
But for now, I am spending most of my time developing and documenting [Hermit's Heresy](/hermits-heresy/),
a library of power tools for Dragon Quest Builders 2.

# Study the Blade!
If you haven't yet seen my [Study the Blade](/stb/) project, please check it out!

# Future Plans
I imagine I will be playing DQB2 for the rest of my life.
What game could possibly dethrone it?

But as of July 2024, the DQB2 in-game noticeboard is not working correctly.
Voting is no longer possible; every new snapshot and island has zero votes.
Visiting other builders' islands still works, for now, but the situation is concerning.
If visiting ever stops working, we builders will need an unofficial replacement.
And if that day comes, I hope to be ready and able to build and host it.
DQB Forever!

## What would it look like?
- Upload snapshots (any image file). Arrange into albums/slideshows with generous-length captions.
- Upload save files for other people to download and "visit" (by temporarily adopting the save file).
- Public likes, private ratings, no comments.
