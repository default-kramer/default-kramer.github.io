# Welcome
My apologies for the spartan website design.
Surely I will improve it someday.
But for now, I am spending most of my time developing and documenting [Hermit's Heresy](/hermits-heresy/),
a library of power tools for Dragon Quest Builders 2.

# Study the Blade!
If you haven't yet seen my [Study the Blade](/stb/) project, please check it out!

# Future Plans
I imagine I will be playing DQB2 for the rest of my life.
What game could possibly dethrone it?

I have many improvements planned for Hermit's Heresy, but perhaps my loftiest goal
is to be able to generate beautiful terrain.
It could be fully random or heavily guided by the user.
Imagine being able to generate an island using a sequence of steps like:

- RollingHills
	- max slope: 2
	- min plateau size: 14
	- average plateau Y: 42
	- mottle:
		- Grassy-Earth: 5
		- Limegrassy-Earth: 2
		- Earth: 1
		- Clodstone: 1
- Mountain
	- height: 93
	- max width: 40
	- min width: 25
	- mottle:
		- Chert: 2
		- Chunky-Chert: 2
		- Light-Dolomite: 3
		- Dark-Dolomite: 5
- PineForest
	- density: 0.13
	- groves:
		- probability: 0.05
		- min width: 8
		- max width: 25
		- density: 0.38

Then you load the game, explore the world you've just generated, and let the inspiration flow!
